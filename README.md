# 🧏‍♀️ Signease: Unified ASL Translator Hub

**Signease** is a user-friendly desktop application that brings together multiple American Sign Language (ASL) translation tools into a single interface.

---

## 💡 Features

1. **Sign Language to Audio Translator**  
   Uses hand gesture recognition from a webcam to detect ASL letters and speak them aloud.

2. **YouTube to ASL Interpreter**  
   Fetches captions from YouTube videos and displays corresponding ASL letter animations using pre-stored sign videos.

3. **Audio to ASL Translator**  
   Listens to audio from the microphone and displays matching ASL signs as videos.

## 🐍 Python Version

- Requires **Python 3.7 or higher**  
  (Recommended: Python 3.10+ for best package support)

## 🚀 Running the App

Launch the hub interface:

```bash
python main.py
```

Then select one of the translator tools from the GUI.

---

## 📝 Notes

- Ensure your webcam and microphone are properly connected.
- Store ASL sign videos for each alphabet as `A.mp4`, `B.mp4`, ... inside a folder named `gifs/`.
- Trained model and label files should be inside the `M/` directory.

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Add support for full-word translation.
- Use deep learning models for improved accuracy.
- Add support for real-time ASL feedback overlay on videos.
